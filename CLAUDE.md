# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude working in this repo. For schema, project layout,
and the full add-a-batch workflow, **read README.md first** — this file
only covers what the README doesn't (behavioral rules, not documentation).

## Always ship after making changes

After any edit to `data/` (new questions, category changes) or app code,
run:

```
npm run ship -- "commit message"
```

Do not leave changes staged/uncommitted and do not run `git add` /
`git commit` / `git push` manually — `ship` bundles validate → bump
version → stamp cache → add → commit → push in the right order, and
skipping steps (e.g. committing without stamping) means phones won't
pick up new content. Write the commit message yourself based on the
actual diff; `ship` won't do that part for you.

If `npm run validate` fails, fix the reported errors before shipping —
don't bypass it.

## Adding question batches

- Follow the exact schema and process in README.md ("Adding a new batch
  of questions"). Don't re-derive it from scratch each session.
- IDs must be unique **across the whole dataset**, not just the file —
  check the highest existing number in that category before picking the
  next batch's range (e.g. this repo currently has `friends` through
  ~450, `big-bang-theory` through ~450, `general` through ~2600).
- Warnings from `validate` about near-duplicate questions are judgment
  calls, not automatic failures — only fix ones that are actually the
  same question reworded.

## What not to do

- Don't add a build step, framework, or bundler — this is intentionally
  plain HTML/CSS/JS with no build step.
- Don't hand-edit `version.json` — `ship`/`stamp-version.js` owns it.
